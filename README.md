# AwesomeProject

Welcome to AwesomeProject! This is a Expo React Native project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- React Native CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Amir786H/MovieApp-Expo.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd AwesomeProject
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the App

To run the app on an emulator or a physical device:

#### iOS

```sh
npx expo start --ios
```

#### Android

```sh
npx expo start --android
```


#### Note
Make sure you are on the same Wi-Fi network on your computer and your device.

If it still doesn't work, it may be due to the router configuration — this is common for public networks. You can work around this by choosing the Tunnel connection type when starting the development server, then scanning the QR code again.

```sh
npx expo start --tunnel
     or 
npx expo start -c
```
